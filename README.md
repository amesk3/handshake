## Setup

You need to have the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) installed to bootstrap your GraphQL server using `graphql create`:

```sh
npm install -g graphql-cli
```

## Getting started

```sh
# Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000)
yarn start
```

## Documentation

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server on `http://localhost:4000`
* `yarn prisma <subcommand>` gives access to local version of Prisma CLI (e.g. `yarn prisma deploy`)

## Contributing

The GraphQL boilerplates are maintained by the GraphQL community, with official support from the [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) & [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) teams.
